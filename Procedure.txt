Overall Procedure for Research: Designing and Optimizing PD-1 Binding Antibodies

1. Problem Definition and Literature Review
Understand the structure and function of the PD-1 receptor.
Identify clinically approved PD-1 antibodies (e.g., Pembrolizumab, Tislelizumab) and their mechanisms.
Define objectives:
Optimize binding to PD-1.
Enhance specificity and minimize off-target effects.
Improve pharmacokinetic properties.

2. Structural Modeling of PD-1
Obtain crystal structures of PD-1 (e.g., 5GGS, 5WT9) from the Protein Data Bank.
Align and merge these structures using:
RosettaCM for comparative modeling.
Perform structure refinement with Rosetta Relax to resolve clashes and optimize geometry.

3. Docking Antibodies to PD-1
Retrieve antibody structures (e.g., Pembrolizumab, Nivolumab) from PDB or model them using RosettaAntibody.
Perform RosettaDock simulations:
Align antibodies to PD-1's extracellular domain.
Identify binding residues and critical interactions.
Analyze docking scores and interface details using InterfaceAnalyzer.

4. Analyze Binding Mechanisms
Use RosettaInterfaceAnalyzer or hbonds tools to:
Identify residues involved in hydrogen bonding, salt bridges, and hydrophobic interactions.
Map complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of antibodies interacting with PD-1.
Visualize interactions in PyMOL or Chimera.

5. Pharmacokinetics and ADME Analysis
Use Simcyp or equivalent tools for pharmacokinetic modeling of the antibodies:
Predict absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties.
Correlate structure (e.g., CDRs, glycosylation sites) with ADME properties.

6. Design and Optimize New Antibodies
Use RosettaAntibodyDesign (RAbD):
Generate antibody variants by mutating or grafting CDR loops.
Optimize binding affinity while maintaining structural stability.
Evaluate designed antibodies through docking simulations with PD-1.

7. Docking in Explicit Solvent
Add water molecules around the PD-1 binding site using SolvatedDock in Rosetta.
Perform docking simulations to evaluate water-mediated interactions.
Identify critical water molecules contributing to binding.

8. Validate Specificity and Off-Target Effects
Dock optimized antibodies to similar receptors (e.g., PD-L1) using RosettaDock.
Compare binding scores to assess specificity.
Ensure minimal off-target interactions.

9. Molecular Dynamics Simulations
Convert docked complexes to simulation-ready formats (e.g., for GROMACS or AMBER).
Perform simulations to:
Assess antibody stability and conformational flexibility.
Observe long-term interactions under physiological conditions.

10. Experimental Validation (Future Steps)
Synthesize high-scoring antibodies.
Test binding affinity using biophysical methods (e.g., SPR, ITC).
Perform cell-based assays to validate functionality and specificity.

11. Iterative Refinement
Use insights from simulations and experiments to refine the antibody design.
Repeat docking, MD simulations, and ADME analysis as needed.

Deliverables:
High-affinity, specific PD-1-binding antibodies.
Structural insights into binding mechanisms.
Improved pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy.
